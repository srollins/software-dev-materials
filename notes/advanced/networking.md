Computer Networking
===================

<!--Why study computer networking in a distributed systems class?

1. A distributed system relies on a network for communication. The performance of the network has a direct effect on the performance of the application.

2. The Internet is a distributed system and the underlying principles and algorithms are applicable to building application-layer distributed systems.

# The Internet

The Internet is a "network of networks". It is a hierarchical system that must take messages and route them from one host to another.

Inside of the Internet are a series of routers and switches that forward messages in a best-effort manner. The core of the Internet makes no guarantees about whether a message will actually arrive at its destination. The Internet also uses packet switching. Each packet sent into the network is routed independently, so messages sent from one host to another can arrive out of order.

# Layered Model

If you’ve previously taken a networking class you may have studied the OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model. The ISO (International Organization for Standardization) developed this seven-layer model that

Like with object-oriented code design, or the service oriented architecture model, a layered protocol design provides a modular way to describe the functions required of a network and how each layer will communicate, and then allows different implementations of each layer. A new transport protocol could be deployed in the network stack without affecting the routing protocol used, for example. 

The Internet protocol stack, on the other hand, essentially folds the functionality of the Presentation and Session layers into the Application.

![https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3b/UDP_encapsulation.svg/800px-UDP_encapsulation.svg.png](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3b/UDP_encapsulation.svg/800px-UDP_encapsulation.svg.png)
> https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3b/UDP_encapsulation.svg/800px-UDP_encapsulation.svg.png

When a message is sent, each layer will process the message, perhaps break it up into smaller pieces, and add its own header before passing it to the layer below. The transport layer takes an application-layer message and adds a transport-layer header to create a segment. The network layer takes a transport-layer segment and adds a network-layer header to produce a network-layer datagram. The link layer takes the datagram and adds a link-layer header to produce a link-layer frame. As the data traverses the network, each layer will strip off the appropriate header and pass the resulting message to the layer above. The routers in the core of the internet only go as far as the network layer to determine the next hop for the packet. 


# Application Layer

The application developer writes code that executes at the application layer. A single host may run multiple applications, and an application-layer protocol defines the communication between these processes communicating across the network. HTTP is one example of an application-layer protocol. SMTP and FTP are two other examples.

The application layer communicates with the transport layer via a socket. When the transport layer has a message to deliver to the application layer it determines which socket to use based on the **port number** specified in the message. When an application creates a socket it determines which transport layer protocol to use.

## HTTP

The HyperText Transfer Protocol was originally used for communication between web clients and servers. Today, it is used in many ways beyond just simple web browsing, for example as the communication mechanism between backend microservices.

Recall that for most web requests the client will request a web page, then request several additional resources that appear on the page, for example images. HTTP 1.0 required the client to open a new connection for every request. A big change in HTTP 1.1 was that it allowed persistent connections, so the same connection could be reused to make multiple requests. Because of the way that TCP operates, this can result in significant performance gains.


In the past few years, there have been significant changes to HTTP. As you can see from the following diagram from the [Akamai Developer Blog](https://developer.akamai.com/blog/2020/04/14/quick-introduction-http3), HTTP 1.1 was dominant for many years. Rollout of HTTP/2 starting in the mid-2010s, and HTTP/3 is currently gaining adoption.

> https://developer.akamai.com/sites/default/files/inline-images/image1_18.png


HTTP/2 was designed to decrease latency and improve performance. As noted on [Akami's website](https://http2.akamai.com/), HTTP/2 offers the following:

> Multiplexing and concurrency: Several requests can be sent in rapid succession on the same TCP connection, and responses can be received out of order - eliminating the need for multiple connections between the client and the server
>
Stream dependencies: the client can indicate to the server which of the resources are more important
than the others
>
Header compression: HTTP header size is drastically reduced
>
Server push: The server can send resources the client has not yet requested

HTTP/3 differs from HTTP/2 in that it does not use the Transport Control Protocol (TCP) as its transport layer. The following resources provide more detail about HTTP/3:

# Transport Layer

The transport layer maintains an end-to-end connection between two hosts. The two transport-layer protocols most used in the Internet are TCP and UDP. The Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) was traditionally used for any application that requires reliability from the transport layer. The User Datagram Protocol (UDP) was traditionally used for applications that are unreliable. It provides little functionality over raw IP. It is used, however, for applications such as real-time streaming where resending old packets is not helpful for the application. It may also be used if the application developer wants to provide a custom reliability mechanism. HTTP/3 operates on top of UDP and uses a new protocol, QUIC, to provide TCP-like transport layer functionality in user space.

## TCP 

TCP is a connection-oriented, reliable transport protocol. Among other things, TCP provides reliability, flow control, and congestion control.

### Reliability

TCP provides reliable message delivery by using acknowledgements, timeouts and retransmissions. When TCP sends a message it sets a timer to indicate the message is outstanding. If the timer reaches a timeout interval before an acknowledgement is received for the message then the message is resent. TCP keeps an estimate of the expected round trip time (RTT), the time for a message to reach the receiver and for the receiver's ACK to reach the sender, and uses that estimate to set the timeout interval. 

ACKs actually indicate the next byte of data expected. It is possible that a sender can receive several ACKs for the same byte if several packets are sent, one is lost, but the others get through. In this case, TCP will use fast retransmit to resend the lost packet. 

### Flow Control

The receive window is a value provided by the receiver to indicate how much data it is able to receive and process. This prevents the sender from overwhelming the receiver.

### Congestion Control

Flow control prevents the sender from overwhelming the receiver while congestion control prevents the sender from overwhelming the network. The basic idea is that a sender will continuously probe the networking, increasing the sending rate as long as congestion is not detected. When congestion is detected, the sender will reduce the rate at which packets are sent and then go back to probing the network.

> http://www.cisco.com/c/dam/en_us/about/ac123/ac147/images/ipj/ipj_9-2/92_gig_fig_01_lg.jpg

#### Detection and Responding to Congestion

The existing, widely deployed TCP implementations use loss-based congestion control. When a sender does not receive an ACK from the receiver within the timeout interval for the packet, the packet is considered lost and the sender interprets the loss as congestion. Repeated ACKs for the same data are also interpreted as congestion.

A congestion event triggers an aggressive decrease in the congestion window (cwnd), that is the amount of data the sender can have outstanding. Depending on the type of event and the version of TCP, the window will be decreased by some factor, or in some cases set back to 1.

#### Slow Start

When a TCP flow begins, it uses slow start to attempt to figure out the amount of available bandwidth quickly. It starts by sending only one segment and waiting for a reply. As long as a congestion event is not detected, the sender will exponentially increase the cwnd each RTT, until it reaches a threshold. In 2010, Google published [An Argument for Increasing TCP's Initial Congestion Window](https://research.google.com/pubs/pub36640.html) and it is pretty common to tune the initial congestion window to use larger values.


## QUIC

[QUIC](https://www.chromium.org/quic) was original developed at Google as a user-space alternative to TCP that would improve web performance. It runs on top of UDP and implements many of the components of TCP, including congestion control and reliability, in user space. It also provides encryption at the application layer.

# Network Layer

The network layer handles routing in the Internet. The Internet Protocol (IP) manages addressing and routing.

A router has multiple interfaces, and a routing algorithm is used to populate a forwarding table that specifies how to move packets from incoming to outgoing interfaces. When a packet destined for a particular address arrives on one interface, the router consults the forwarding table to determine the appropriate outgoing interface for the packet. Organizations are typically assigned blocks of IP address with the same prefix, so the routing table aggregates multiple addresses into one entry.

Routers are organized into Autonomous Systems (AS) where an AS is usually a single organization or administrative domain. An inter-domain routing protocol is used to route between ASs and an intra-domain routing protocol is used for routing with an AS. The Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) is the inter-domain routing protocol used in the Internet. Routers that sit at the edge of an AS connect to border routers in other ASs. These routers periodically send updates about the ASs they can reach, and populate their routing tables based on those routes. Intra-domain routing may use one of a variety of protocols. Some intra-domain routing protocols work similarly to BGP, and others use algorithms more similar to Djikstra's shortest path algorithm.

The BGP routing table has grown significantly from 1994 to now!

# Link Layer/Physical Layer

The link layer connects two adjacent hosts and the physical layer handles how bits are actually transmitted from host to host. A message moving from source to destination will generally traverse several links and each link may use a different link-layer protocol depending on the type of connection.

Depending on the underlying technology, the link layer may implement several different functions including error detection and correction, flow control, reliability, or link access. The link layer may also be referred to as the MAC (medium access control) layer, and each *interface* on a host has a hardware or MAC address.

Links may be point-to-point, or broadcast based. A broadcast medium, such as wireless ethernet, must implement a multiple access protocol that allows multiple hosts to share the medium. There are many styles of protocols that are implement in broadcast networks. In some cases, hosts may follow an explicit turn taking protocol. In some cases, hosts may send messages on the medium and, if a collision is detected, stop and wait for some time before trying to send again. 

<!--## WebSockets

The traditional client-server web model assumes that the client initiates the connection and the server is stateless. That isn't to say that the server doesn't keep state about clients that may be retrieved based upon a cookie or token, however there is no state associated with the specific request. This becomes a limiting factor in many applications, for example a home automation system.

WebSockets are a new(ish) protocol that allow a client and server to maintain a persistent connection over a long period of time. The client uses HTTP to make the initial connection to the server, but specifies a header that indicates it would like to upgrade to websockets. If the server is able, it will then upgrade the socket and maintain a long-running TCP connection with the client. The benefit of this model is that the server may push content to the client, at the cost of maintaining state about all open connections on the server side.

<!--#### BBR

In December 2016, Google published an article on [BBR: Congestion-Based Congestion Control](http://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?id=3022184). The fundamental idea is that loss is that in modern networks is not the best way to detect congestion. They argue that the optimal operating point is at the bandwidth delay product (BDP) line, and the sending rate may reach that point long before a loss occurs.

<!--They propose an algorithm that will  monitor both the RTT and the bottleneck bandwidth, and adapt sending rate to match the bottleneck bandwidth. The algorithm periodically probes to see if the bottleneck bandwidth has increased and, if so, the overall sending rate increases.
